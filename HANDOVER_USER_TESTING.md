## ⚠️ Potential Issues & Monitoring Points

### ✅ **RESOLVED CRITICAL ISSUES**
1. **✅ CSRF Vulnerability**: Fixed in both login and register routes with explicit origin validation
2. **✅ Environment Variables**: All required Supabase config now set on Vercel
3. **✅ API Endpoints**: Events API working correctly and returning FAMI event data
4. **✅ Database**: Clean state with only real event data
5. **✅ TypeScript Errors**: Build errors resolved in events API route

### 🟡 Minor Concerns (Monitor but likely OK)
1. **Email Delivery**: Resend.dev configured but test email sending in practice
2. **User Feedback**: No built-in feedback mechanism yet
3. **Mobile Experience**: Should be responsive but worth monitoring
4. **Load Testing**: Not tested with concurrent users
5. **CodeRabbit Suggestions**: Some minor cleanup items identified but non-critical

### 🟢 Low Risk Items
- Some duplicate files (cleaned up)
- TypeScript warnings in build (not blocking functionality)
- Supabase Edge Runtime warnings (cosmetic, not functional)

### ❌ Confirmed Working
- ✅ **Event display** (FAMI event showing correctly)
- ✅ **Database connectivity** (Supabase operational)  
- ✅ **API endpoints** (Events API returning proper JSON)
- ✅ **Authentication flow** (Login/Register routes secured)
- ✅ **Security protections** (CSRF fixed, origin validation active)
- ✅ **Production deployment** (Vercel environment properly configured)
